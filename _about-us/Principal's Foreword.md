<h4><strong>Principal’s Foreword</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>Welcome to Queenstown Primary School.</p>
<p>The year 2025 has been one of deep listening and collaborative visioning.
Through extensive engagement with our staff, students, parents, and community
partners, we have grappled with important questions: How do we better prepare
Queenstown Primary for the future? What kind of learning community do we
want to be? These conversations have been both challenging and enriching,
pushing us to think deeply about our purpose.</p>
<p>From these honest exchanges emerged a renewed sense of direction – one
that honours our proud 70-year heritage whilst embracing the uncertainties
of the future. Our theme for 2025 to 2026, <strong>"Weaving Our Heritage to Shape Tomorrow's Tapestry,"</strong> reflects
this journey. Like a tapestry, our school is woven from many threads –
the experiences of generations of students, the dedication of teachers
past and present, the support of families, and the values that have anchored
us through changing times. Each thread matters. Some threads represent
our traditions and what has worked well; others represent new approaches
we are learning to embrace. As we approach our 70th anniversary in 2026,
we recognise that weaving these threads together requires patience, skill,
and the willingness to sometimes unpick and reweave when needed.</p>
<p>Our refreshed vision expresses our aspirations for every Queenstowner: <strong>Confident Leaders and Caring Citizens who are Change Makers.</strong> Being
a change maker begins in small, meaningful ways – through acts of leadership
like standing up for a classmate or proposing solutions, and through acts
of care like protecting their environment or bringing joy to others. From
these foundations, students will grow to tackle bigger challenges and create
greater impact as they progress through their years with us and beyond.</p>
<p>To realise this vision, we have articulated our mission as <strong>a caring learning community that nurtures hearts and empowers all.</strong> We
see ourselves as a community where care is at the centre of everything
we do – where teachers care deeply about each child's growth and for one
another as fellow learners, where students learn to care for each other
and their environment, and where deep, meaningful learning can take place.
When we nurture hearts, we attend to the whole person – their character,
sense of purpose, and emotional well-being. When we empower all, we unlock
potential in everyone, recognising that each child and each staff member
brings unique strengths and possibilities to our community.</p>
<p>At the heart of this mission are our <strong>GRACE values</strong> – <strong>Gratitude</strong>, <strong>Resilience</strong>, <strong>Accountability, Care</strong>,
and<strong> Empathy</strong>, as well as our <strong>IMPACT dispositions</strong> – <strong>Inventive</strong>,<strong> Mindful</strong>,<strong> Proactive, Adaptable</strong>, <strong>Collaborative</strong>,
and<strong> Tenacious</strong>. We believe deeply that strong character
is the foundation upon which all meaningful learning is built. Our GRACE
values guide how we interact with the world, whilst our IMPACT dispositions
are the habits of mind that enable us to apply our knowledge and values
in real situations. Together, they equip our students with the character
and competencies to become confident leaders and caring citizens who are
change makers, embodied in our school motto: <strong>Onward to Success: Live with GRACE, reach with IMPACT.</strong> Education
transcends preparing students for examinations – the true measure of success
lies in how they navigate life's challenges and opportunities, and embrace
the responsibility of making a positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>With this refreshed vision and mission, we have greater clarity in shaping
our curriculum to meet the evolving needs of our learners and in creating
meaningful learning that prepares every child for the future. Our signature
programmes – Environment Project-Based Learning (E-PBL) and Connecting
Hearts with the Arts – will continue to provide rich opportunities for
students to develop these values and dispositions through deep learning
experiences. This commitment to continuous renewal takes on special significance
as we celebrate our 70th anniversary in 2026, a milestone that invites
us to honour our past whilst giving back to the community that has supported
us throughout the decades.</p>
<p>Thank you for your strong support and partnership. We cannot do this without
you as we journey onwards together, weaving our heritage to shape tomorrow's
tapestry.</p>
<p>Onward to Success!</p>
<p>Mrs Olivia Cheong
