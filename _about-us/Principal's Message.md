<h4><strong>Principal’s Foreward</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Dear Parents,</strong>
<br>Welcome to Queenstown Primary School.</p>
<p>It is both an honor and a privilege to serve as the principal of this
vibrant and forward-looking school. I would like to begin by expressing
my heartfelt gratitude to my predecessor, Ms Pearly Ng, for her exceptional
leadership and dedication. Under her guidance, Queenstown Primary has fostered
a nurturing and innovative environment that has set a strong foundation
for our school community. I am committed to building on this legacy, deepening
our sense of belonging, and continuing to create a school where every child
feels supported, valued, and empowered.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, my team and I will further cultivate the nurturing and
innovative culture of Queenstown Primary to inspire and celebrate learning.
I believe that for students to truly flourish, they must engage in meaningful
learning experiences that spark curiosity, encourage deep thinking, and
help them develop 21st-Century Competencies, such as inventive and adaptive
thinking. By tackling real-world issues and tasks that resonate with them
and their communities, students can become agents of change.</p>
<p>At Queenstown Primary, we are dedicated to providing a holistic education
that nurtures not just academic skills but also character, emotional well-being,
and social responsibility. Through our core values of <strong>Respect, Integrity, Resilience, and Gratitude</strong>,
we aim to guide students on their journey to becoming confident, caring
individuals who are equipped to think critically and lead with compassion
in a complex world.</p>
<p>Our signature programmes, <strong>Environment Project-Based Learning (E-PBL)</strong> and <strong>Connecting Hearts with the Arts</strong>,
provide students with the opportunity to explore real-world challenges,
collaborate with their peers, and develop the skills needed to solve problems
creatively. These programmes, together with our focus on fostering <strong>Confident Individuals</strong>, <strong>Critical Thinkers</strong>,<strong> Caring Citizens</strong>,
and<strong> Effective Leaders</strong>—our Queenstowner Outcomes (QtOs)—ensure
that every child is prepared to thrive as both a learner and a responsible
global citizen.</p>
<p>I look forward to collaborating with our dedicated teachers to design
deep learning experiences that empower students to tackle these challenges
and make a positive impact on their communities. Through these efforts,
I am confident that we will equip our students with the skills and mindset
needed to navigate and thrive in an increasingly complex world.</p>
<p>Thank you for entrusting us with your child’s education. I am excited
to continue working alongside you, our staff, and the wider community to
ensure that every child feels a deep sense of belonging and is empowered
to reach their fullest potential.</p>
<p><strong>Onward to Success!</strong>
</p>
<p>Mrs Olivia Cheong
<br>Principal</p>
