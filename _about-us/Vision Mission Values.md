The school crest comprises three jewels on a crown. It symbolizes the fresh new dynamism of Queenstown Primary School. The three jewels represent the three primary schools, Mei Chin, Queenstown and Tanglin, which merged to form the crown, Queenstown Primary School.

The school colours are blue, green and red. Blue signifies peace and tranquillity in the school. Green signifies growing of young minds and developing their capabilities and competencies. Red signifies our passion for learning and the love we have for our nation.
