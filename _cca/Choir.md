#### **About CCA**
Queenstown Primary School Choir provides platforms like SYF, Visual Open School, End of Year Concert, National Day Concert, Show Choir Competition and QtPS Talent Show and music videos to explore different performing arts forms like choral singing, contemporary singing , dancing showmanship and  musicianship.

Through the Choir, students are provided with opportunities to be:

##### **Confident Individual and Singers as Choir Advocates**
Students are given opportunities to showcase their singing and dancing talents in school concerts and competitions like Show Choir Competition and SYF

##### **Critical Thinkers as Choir Advocates**
Performance learning experiences in concerts and competitions are provided to students through choir practice. These are complemented by experiences in concert hall settings like SOTA which enables them to be a better singer in a “live” sound setting. The process of music video making too also allows the Choir to understand the skill sets needed for being a professional singer in a commercial setting. Through the hands on experiences as a singer in various settings from choral singing in a “live” sound setting, to working with sound engineers in a hall setting and post sound and editing music video making processes, the students reflect on their experiences as a young musician and singer.

##### **Caring Citizen as Choir Advocates**
Students are guided through an Experience – Concept-Approach (ECA) which makes connections to musicians and singers. Reflecting, exploring and problem solving the different vocal techniques, pitching and musicianship when faced with challenges during brainstorming for the soundscapes and music making.<br>
Students also learn by reflecting on their own music making process and singing techniques to find their individual unique voice. They also provide feedback to their peers on their singing, sound, dance moves, showmanship and musicianship.
