#### **About CCA**
##### **Introduction**
The Science and Green Club aims to develop a keen interest in Science and a care for the environment in our members. The club activities encourage investigation, curiosity and inquiry into deeper scientific and environmental knowledge. We have various programmes to develop our members into confident individuals, critical thinkers, caring citizens and effective leaders. Here are some of our signature programme and platforms for our members:

##### **Gardening@QtPS**
Our members began our journey into gardening and producing our own crops in 2021 as part of our school's efforts in working towards a Sustainable Singapore.  The students tried their hands at growing local crops like kai lan and lettuce. The crops were then harvested by our members and donated to the community fridge at Block 166 Stirling Road which is under the care of Queenstown Stirling View Zone RC.  Our Science and Green Club members learnt to be caring citizens and to lend a helping hand to others in need.

#### **Earth Week** 
Every year, our members embark on organising activities during Earth Week. The preparation starts in Term 1 where our members plan hands-on sessions, experiments and various events for the students. One of our key activities is the student-initiated project on designing outreach lessons to encourage the reduction of plastic waste for the Primary 2 Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) during Earth Week and for the kindergarten visitors. By conducting the lessons both for the Primary 2 students and the kindergarten children, our members learn to be Confident Individuals and Effective Leaders as they work together as a group to achieve this.

Our members are given the platform to showcase what they have learnt during Science and Green Club and educate their fellow schoolmates on being Caring Citizens and developing compassion and civic-mindedness towards the environment around them.

#### **"Every Singaporean A Naturalist" Programme with Nature Society (Singapore)**
As Caring Citizens, our members are involved in the Every Singaporean A Naturalist programme with Nature Society (Singapore) (NSS) where they are engaged in a long-term study and appreciation of nature, focusing on birds in Singapore with the experts and volunteers of NSS. This is done by equipping them with knowledge and skills to identify, monitor and appreciate common species of birds around the school. This teaches them to be compassionate towards animals and plants while educating them on their civic-mindedness.

#### **World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Programmes**
We have regular collaborations with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) where workshops are conducted by WWF volunteers on various topics like Reducing Our Carbon Footprint and Reducing Plastic Waste. The workshop on Reducing Plastic Waste became the foundation of the Primary 2 FTGP lesson on Reducing Plastic Waste which was planned and conducted by all the Science and Green Club members. Through these workshops, our members engage in problem-solving, learn to be good communicators and team players. These help to develop them into Critical Thinkers, Caring Citizens and Effective Leaders.

#### **Field Trips and Learning Journeys**
We provide authentic learning activities outside of school through the semesterly field trip or learning journey. Our members visit various places every year and have done a variety of activities. Over the past few years, our members have gone to:

*  Singapore Science Centre (various workshops e.g. aeroplane making, study of insects etc)
*  Sungei Buloh (Birdwatching) 
*  Singapore Botanical Gardens (how to conduct a garden trail) 
*  Kallang River (waterway clean-up)
*  ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands (WWF exhibit)

After the field trips and learning journeys, our members embark on reflection as Critical Thinkers and become more compassionate and civic-minded as Caring Citizens.
