### **Cyber Wellness**
#### **What is Cyber Wellness?**
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming increasingly pervasive in our world. While creating instant connectivity and access to vast repositories of information, knowledge, and opinions, the open nature of the Internet can expose our students to undesirable content and influences.

Cyber Wellness in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

#### **The 3 Cyber Wellness Key Messages**
*   Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities.
*   Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.
*   Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace.

#### **Cyber Wellness Education at a glance**
Cyber Wellness education is usually conducted through CCE lessons during curriculum time, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject lessons, and learning opportunities beyond school.

*   Activate parental controls on your home devices.
