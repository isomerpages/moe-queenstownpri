### **2017 Award**
#### **National Photography Festival for Primary Schools 2017**

The theme for this year is ‘Uniquely Kolam Ayer’ and the participants spent an entire morning capturing images around Kolam Ayer. By participating in this festival, our students were given the opportunity  to learn, apply and inspire others in the Art of Photography and to inculcate a sense of appreciation for the community and the environment.

Evangelyn Siau (6 Care), Tong Jia Xian (5 Care), Woo Yu Hung (5 Care) and Kaung Khant Kyaw (5 Care), represented our school at the Festival. Evangelyn's entry won the People's Choice award. In addition, our team had also won the Group Special Mention Award. Congratulations, children! You have done QtPS proud!
