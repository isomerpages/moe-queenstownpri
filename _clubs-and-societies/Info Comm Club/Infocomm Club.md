#### **About CCA**
The Infocomm Club offers its members an exciting 4-year journey into Digital Media. Under the guidance of its trainers, students will learn skills such as Digital Photography, Animation, Game Development, Mobile App Development, Video-making and Robotics. Members will get to represent our school to take part in various competitions that are held nation-wide. During the competitions, they will get to learn more skills with hands-on practice and gain more experience in the various aspects of ICT.

In addition, Queenstown Primary School Infocomm Club CCA develops its members by giving them numerous opportunities to become critical thinkers and effective leaders through various collaborative projects and Problem-Based Learning activities. Through these CCA activities, members become confident and self-directed individuals who learn from overcoming problems and challenges throughout their 4-year journey into Digital Media.
