#### **About CCA**
##### **Introduction**
The Science and Green Club aims to develop a keen interest in Science and a care for the environment in our members. The club activities encourage investigation, curiosity and inquiry into deeper scientific and environmental knowledge. We have various programmes to develop our members into confident individuals, critical thinkers, caring citizens and effective leaders. Here are some of our signature programme and platforms for our members:

##### **Gardening@QtPS**
Our members began our journey into gardening and producing our own crops in 2021 as part of our school's efforts in working towards a Sustainable Singapore.  The students tried their hands at growing local crops like kai lan and lettuce. The crops were then harvested by our members and donated to the community fridge at Block 166 Stirling Road which is under the care of Queenstown Stirling View Zone RC.  Our Science and Green Club members learnt to be caring citizens and to lend a helping hand to others in need.
