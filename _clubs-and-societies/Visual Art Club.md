#### **About CCA**
Queenstown Primary School Visual Art Club CCA provides platforms for our students to explore different art forms. Through the Visual Arts Club CCA, students are provided with opportunities to be:

##### **Effective Leaders as Art Advocates**
Students are given the opportunities to showcase their creative artwork in school and in common community spaces (e.g. Queenstown National Library, External School Exhibitions).

##### **Confident Artists and Informed Audience**
Authentic learning experiences are provided to students through lessons in the classroom. These are complemented by experiences in a museum environment which enables them to better value local art as part of Singapore’s heritage. Through the viewing and discussion of artworks, students reflect on their own experiences as audience members.

##### **Critical Thinkers during Art Making**
Students are guided through an Inquiry Based approach which includes making Connections to artists, Investigating the art forms and Problem Solving when faced with challenges during brainstorming and art making. Students also learn by reflecting on their own art making process and providing feedback on their peers’ artwork.
