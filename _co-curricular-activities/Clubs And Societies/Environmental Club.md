<h4><strong>About CCA</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p>The Environmental Club aims to nurture a deep care for the environment
and inspire sustainable living among our members. Our activities encourage
curiosity, active learning and reflection on environmental issues. We expose
students to nature, gardening, and real-world environmental challenges,
where they apply design thinking frameworks to develop creative and practical
solutions. Through these experiences, students learn to grow their own
plants, appreciate the value of natural resources, and cultivate empathy
and a strong desire to protect the environment. We offer various programs
to develop our members into confident individuals, critical thinkers, caring
citizens and effective leaders. Here are some of our signature programs
and platforms for our members:</p>
<h5><strong>Green Garden Heroes</strong></h5>
<p>Our members began their exciting journey into gardening in 2021 as part
of our school’s efforts to build a more Sustainable Singapore. Along the
way, they have proudly succeeded in growing a variety of crops, including
papaya, basil leaves, curry leaves, bitter gourd and chili. In 2025, the
club is taking our Eco-Garden to the next level by adding innovative vegetable
towers to grow fresh green leafy vegetables such as kai lan, chye sim and
kang kong. The vegetables harvested will be shared with our canteen vendors
and teachers, spreading the joy of homegrown produce. Through this hands-on
adventure, students develop a growth mindset and learn to think critically
as they tackle the challenges that come with gardening. Most importantly,
they discover that sustainable living is not only possible but also a rewarding
experience right here in Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>Ocean Keepers</strong></h4>
<p>This year, our students embarked on the inspiring Ocean Keepers Program,
where they explored real-world environmental challenges through the Design
Thinking Framework. As part of their journey, the students had the unique
opportunity to interview award-winning whale photographer Ms. Jasmine Carey,
gaining first-hand insights into the impact of ocean pollution on marine
life. Motivated by what they learned, students collaborated in teams to
design and build creative prototypes aimed at reducing or eliminating trash
in our oceans. Through this program, the students sharpened their critical
thinking and communication skills, and as they presented their ideas, they
blossomed into confident speakers. Students also developed a strong sense
of empathy for the environment and marine life. To inspire others, they
showcased their innovative ideas during recess, sparking meaningful conversations
and raising awareness among their peers about the importance of protecting
our oceans.</p>

<h4><strong>Earth Week</strong></h4>
<p>Every year, our members take the lead in organizing Earth Week at Queenstown
Primary School. This year, they set up lively booths during recess to spread
awareness about ocean pollution and proudly showcased their innovative
prototypes designed to reduce trash in the ocean.</p>
<p>To inspire younger students, they created fun, interactive games for the
Primary 2 classes, teaching them how to protect marine life and take action
against pollution. When they visited classrooms during FTGP to run the
activities, their efforts were met with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Our CCA leaders also delivered powerful morning assembly speeches to rally
the school community around this important cause. Through these experiences,
students grew into confident speakers, critical thinkers, and caring citizens
determined to make a difference.</p>

<h4><strong>Field Trips and Learning Journeys</strong></h4>
<p>Our members take part in exciting field trips and learning journeys that
bring environmental education to life in meaningful ways. Whether they
are building aeroplanes at the Science Centre, discovering the secrets
of urban farming at City Sprouts Farm, or exploring how to run a garden
trail at the Botanic Gardens, every outing offers hands-on learning and
fresh perspectives.</p>
<p>They have tracked migratory birds at Sungei Buloh, helped clean up the
Kallang River, and explored powerful conservation exhibits at the ArtScience
Museum. Each experience sparks curiosity, teamwork, and a deeper appreciation
of how everyone can play a part in caring for the environment.</p>
<p>Through these authentic learning opportunities, our students develop critical
thinking skills, grow into confident communicators, and cultivate empathy
as they learn to be responsible stewards of our planet.</p>
