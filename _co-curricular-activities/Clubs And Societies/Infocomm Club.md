The Infocomm Club offers its members an exciting 4-year journey into Digital Media. Under the guidance of its trainers, students will learn skills such as Digital Photography, Animation, Game Development, Mobile App Development, Video-making and Robotics. Members will get to represent our school to take part in various competitions that are held nation-wide.

In addition, Queenstown Primary School Infocomm Club CCA develops its members by giving them numerous opportunities to become critical thinkers and effective leaders through various collaborative projects and Problem-Based Learning activities.

### **2017 Award**
#### **National Photography Festival for Primary Schools 2017**

The theme for this year is ‘Uniquely Kolam Ayer’ and the participants spent an entire morning capturing images around Kolam Ayer. By participating in this festival, our students were given the opportunity  to learn, apply and inspire others in the Art of Photography and to inculcate a sense of appreciation for the community and the environment.

Evangelyn Siau (6 Care), Tong Jia Xian (5 Care), Woo Yu Hung (5 Care) and Kaung Khant Kyaw (5 Care), represented our school at the Festival. Evangelyn's entry won the People's Choice award. In addition, our team had also won the Group Special Mention Award. Congratulations, children! You have done QtPS proud!
