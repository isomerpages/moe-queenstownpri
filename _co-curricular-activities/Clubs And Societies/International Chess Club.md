#### **About CCA**

The International Chess Club is a newly founded CCA in QtPS that aims to develop critical thinking and proper game dispositions in the members. The Club is divided into the ‘Competitive Team’ and ‘Recreational Team’. Members in the ‘Competitive Team’ learn strategies through quizzes and friendly games. They are encouraged to discuss and learn from each other. Through this experience, they will develop the intellectual flexibility and skills to think of sound strategies when they compete in National Competitions.

The members in the ‘Recreational Team’ attend theory lessons and progressively hone their skills through friendly games with their fellow CCA mates. As they improve, they will be given the opportunity to join the ‘Competitive Team’.

Through the International Chess Club CCA, members will learn that Focus and Effort are paramount to becoming good chess players. They also learn the importance of being gracious and displaying sportsmanship as chess is a ‘gentleman’s game’.
