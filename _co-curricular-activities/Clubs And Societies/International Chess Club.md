#### **About CCA**

The International Chess Club aims to develop a life-long love for International Chess, critical thinking skills and proper game dispositions in the members. The Club is divided into the ‘Competitive Team’ and ‘Recreational Team’ based on students’ abilities and preferences.

Members in the ‘Competitive Team’ learn strategies through quizzes and friendly games. They are encouraged to discuss and learn from one another. Through this experience, they will develop the intellectual flexibility and skills to think of sound strategies when they compete in National Competitions.

The members in the ‘Recreational Team’ attend theory lessons and progressively hone their skills through friendly games with their fellow CCA mates. As they improve, they will be given the opportunity to join the ‘Competitive Team’.

Through the International Chess Club CCA, members will learn to be critical thinkers and problem solvers. These skills are paramount to becoming good chess players. As chess is a ‘gentleman’s game’, members will also learn the importance of being reflective, gracious and displaying sportsmanship which will serve them well in school and beyond.
