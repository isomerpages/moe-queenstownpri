#### **About CCA**
The QtPS Weiqi Club is currently made up of 36 members. The CCA allows members to learn different strategies involved in playing the game of Weiqi. Members learn strategies progressively and hone their skills through friendly games with their fellow CCA mates. Members are grouped into junior and senior groups to better cater to their learning needs.

Queenstown Primary School Weiqi Club CCA provides platforms for our students to gain exposure, new insights and experiences to enhance their Weiqi skills. Members of each level are selected by the instructor and teachers-in-charge to form school teams to represent the school to participate in the annual Weiqi Competition organized by the Singapore Weiqi Association (SWA) or The GO Academy.

Through the Weiqi Club CCA, our members are provided with opportunities to be:

##### **Problem Solver**
Regular CCA sessions, friendly matches during CCA sessions. Instructor provides challenging Weiqi questions for members to solve (Eg. defend, surround and score points)

##### **Good Communicator**
CCA leaders and selected members are involved in Learning Extravaganza and P2 CCA Fair. The selected members were able to listen, clarify their queries and concerns and to guide the P2 students patiently.<br>
Selected senior members were paired up with the juniors to coach them to enhance their Weiqi skills.

On 20 April 2024, 17 members of our Weiqi Club participated in the GO Academy Cup National GO Championship 2024. The results are as follows:

Before every CCA session, our members take the CCA pledge to remind themselves on the need to Focus, Think and Persevere in their training.  Our  training consists of instructor-led teaching of concepts and strategies, student-centric problem-solving in pairs/groups, as well as gameplay and review. We are also integrating artificial intelligence into lessons to improve students' match play standards.
At Weiqi CCA, we cultivate positive moral values in students. At the end of every session, students reflect on how they have performed and show gratitude to their teammates.
