#### **About CCA**
Queenstown Primary School Weiqi Club CCA has 36 members currently. They are organised into junior, middle and senior groups to better cater to their learning needs.

###### **Confident Individual**
Before every training session, our members take the CCA pledge to remind themselves on the need to Focus, Think and Persevere in their training.  Thereafter, our training starts off with instructor-led teaching of concepts and strategies.

###### **Critical Thinker**
Members carry out student-centric problem-solving in pairs/groups, as well as gameplay and review.  We are also integrating artificial intelligence into lessons to improve students' match-play standards.

###### **Caring Citizen**
At Weiqi Club, we cultivate civic-mindedness in students.  At the end of every session, students reflect on how they have performed and show gratitude and sportsmanship to their teammates.  We also groom responsible leaders who are always ready to render service to the club.

###### **Good Communicator**
We train our CCA leaders and selected members to take charge at the Learning Extravaganza and P2 CCA Fair.  They present their knowledge passionately to parents and younger children.

QtPS Weiqi Club  provides platforms for our students to gain exposure, new insights and experiences to enhance their Weiqi skills. Members of various learning abilities are selected by the instructor and teachers-in-charge represent the school in the annual competitions organized by the The GO Academy or Singapore Weiqi Association (SWA).

On 20 April 2024, 17 members of our Weiqi Club participated in the GO Academy Cup National GO Championship 2024. The results are as follows:
