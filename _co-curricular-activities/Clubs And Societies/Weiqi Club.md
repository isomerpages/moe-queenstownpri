#### **About CCA**
The QtPS Weiqi Club is currently made up of 32 members. The CCA allows members to learn different strategies involved in playing the game of Weiqi. Members learn strategies progressively and hone their skills through friendly games with their fellow CCA mates. Members are grouped into junior and senior groups to better cater to their learning needs.

Queenstown Primary School Weiqi Club CCA provides platforms for our students to gain exposure, new insights and experiences to enhance their Weiqi skills. Members of each level are selected by the instructor and teachers-in-charge to form school teams to represent the school to participate in the annual Weiqi Competition organized by the Singapore Weiqi Association (SWA) or The GO Academy.

Through the Weiqi Club CCA, our members are provided with opportunities to be:

##### **Problem Solver**
Regular CCA sessions, friendly matches during CCA sessions. Instructor provides challenging Weiqi questions for members to solve (Eg. defend, surround and score points)

##### **Team Player**
The members are divided into 3 groups according to their attributes, characteristics and strengths. Group points are allocated when they display good values throughout the Weiqi session.<br>
They cooperate with their CCA leader and group members.

##### **Good Communicator**
CCA leaders and selected members are involved in Open House and P2 CCA trials. The selected members were able to listen, clarify their queries and concerns and to guide the P2 students patiently.<br>
Selected senior members were paired up with the juniors to coach them to enhance their Weiqi skills.

I joined Weiqi CCA for two years when I was in P3.I joined this CCA because I thought it was interesting and my parents told me that this game uses strategies and trains my critical thinking. I learnt many different Weiqi strategies (Atari, extend, descend, snapback, ladder, connect and die) to make the game advantageous for me and hopefully let me win the game.  Also, I learnt sportsmanship when I get defeated by seniors and I can learn tactics from them. As a Weiqi CCA leader, I have opportunity to be a problem solver. I don’t give up easily and try to solve the challenging questions given to me. The CCA also trains me to become a better communicator. During the P2 CCA trial, I listened and clarified the queries raised by the P2 students.

I joined Weiqi CCA for four years when I was in P3. I watched some Weiqi competition videos and a series of Weiqi anime Video (Hikaru No Go) and I begin to find it interesting and fun to learn Weiqi. I still remembered that during P2 CCA Trial, when I played the Weiqi board game for the first time, I felt excited and decided to join Weiqi CCA. During Weiqi CCA, I also have a chance to solve challenging questions together with my peers; it helps me to work my brain and learn from mistakes too. I also had the opportunity to represent the school to participate in the inter-school competition. I can learn more Weiqi strategies from my opponents from other schools. As a Weiqi senior member, I have opportunity to pair up with the juniors to coach them and enhance their Weiqi skills. It also trains my leadership skills to be a better communicator. It also trains my perseverance when I get tired in a long game
