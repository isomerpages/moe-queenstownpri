<h4><strong>About CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Queenstown Primary School Chinese Dance CCA seeks to enrich its members
with basic skills in both Chinese classical and ethnic folk dance movements
incorporating elements of Chinese martial arts and gymnastics.</p>
<p>Through the Chinese Dance CCA, students are provided with opportunities
to be:</p>
<h5><strong>Confident Dancer</strong></h5>
<p>Performance platforms in and out of school also help them gain valuable
exposure which build up their confidence and self-esteem while heightening
their sense of aesthetics in efficient movement execution and expressive
performance.</p>
<h5><strong>Critical Thinker</strong></h5>
<p>Through a combination of rigorous exercises such as floor, jumping and
turning that focuses on developing each member’s body flexibility and poise,
our members learn the importance of self discipline, commitment and teamwork.
Students also learn by reflecting on their own progress and providing feedback
to their peers’ artwork.</p>
<h5><strong>Caring Citizen</strong></h5>
<p>Students are given opportunities to participate in school and community
events such as mid-autumn festival celebration.</p>
