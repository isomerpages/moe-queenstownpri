#### **About CCA**
Queenstown Primary School Malay Dance provides platforms for our students an opportunity to learn and experience different forms of Malay Dance such as the traditional and contemporary dance.

Through Malay Dance, we develop students to be an individual with a strength of character. Teamwork and self-discipline become the pillar of every successful performance in and out of school whilst bringing out their personal best aesthetically. Malay Dance members also participate in the biennial SYF Arts Performance at the national level.

Practice and hard work is essential in bringing out the best in every Malay Dancer. Getting the right dance technique and form requires perseverance and teamwork. Through dance, students sharpen their agility and poise. They look better and more importantly feel good about themselves.

##### **Effective Leaders as Malay Dance Ambassadors**

It is just not about dancing! As Malay Dance members, students are ambassadors in schoolâ€™s events such as Learning Extravaganza cum Open House. This is just one of the many platforms for students to present themselves confidently, simultaneously developing the leadership skills in them.
