<h4><strong>About CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Queenstown Primary School Malay Dance provides platforms for our students
an opportunity to learn and experience different forms of Malay Dance such
as the traditional and contemporary dance.</p>
<p>Through Malay Dance, we develop students to be an individual with a strength
of character. Teamwork and self-discipline become the pillar of every successful
performance in and out of school whilst bringing out their personal best
aesthetically. Malay Dance members also participate in the biennial SYF
Arts Performance at the national level.</p>
<h5><strong>Every Member is a Potential Dancer</strong></h5>

<p>Practice and hard work is essential in bringing out the best in every
Malay Dancer. Getting the right dance technique and form requires perseverance
and teamwork. Through dance, students sharpen their agility and poise.
They look better and more importantly feel good about themselves.</p>

<p>It is just not about dancing! As Malay Dance members, students are ambassadors
in schoolâ€™s events such as Learning Extravaganza cum Open House and P2
CCA Fair. This is just one of the many platforms for students to present
themselves confidently, simultaneously developing the leadership skills
in them.</p>
