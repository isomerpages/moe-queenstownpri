#### **About CCA**
The QtPS badminton CCA aims to inspire, ignite a passion of playing badminton and enable every student to realize and develop their potential in this sport. Before the session begins, student leaders will lead the rest of the students for warm up. This routine, instil in students the importance of being a team player, respect and being an effective leader. During the sessions, students will be equipped with a strong foundation of badminton skills and appropriate footwork. Through this process, they learn the importance of perseverance and caring for others. Games and matches are organised frequently where students learn to be patience, confident and think critically as they listen to the coach/CCA teachers.
