#### **About CCA**
The QtPS Basketball CCA aims to develop competent basketball players who demonstrate the school values of Respect, Resilience, Integrity and Gratitude. Teamwork and sportsmanship are also emphasized upon during game-play. During training sessions, our students work on their technical individual ball-handling skills such as passing, dribbling and shooting, as well as tactical knowledge and teamwork. Players will also have a chance to work on their cardiovascular fitness and speed during high-intensity drills.   Members are split into 2 groups, namely, the Competition Group and the Recreation Group, and the activities carried out during training are appropriate for the respective levels. Players will then have a chance to apply these skills and knowledge in the annual zonal competition and smaller-scaled competitions and friendly matches.   Through the pre-training routine and various platforms, students are provided with opportunities to become:

##### **Confident Individual**
Students learn to prepare themselves both physically and mentally during the pre-training routine before the start of every training. They learn to manage themselves and activate their positive thinking to start the session.

##### **Critical Thinker**
Students go through drills and activities during training. They reflect on the feedback given to improve their skills. During small-sided games, they also discuss and come up with strategies to improve their game-play.

##### **Caring Citizen**
Students encourage and help one another during practice. They constantly each other about the spirit of never giving up. They are also taught the value of sportsmanship in which they respect everyone: officials, teammates and opponents.

##### **Effective Leader**
Students are given leadership roles such as Leader, Assistant Leader and Equipment Managers. Such roles are rotated regularly. Students also learn to lead themselves through the emphasis of self-management and functioning as a team. Therefore, during small-sided games, students realize the importance of being a team player.
