#### **About CCA**
The swimming CCA aims to develop competitive swimmers, by providing them with a platform to develop their potential. Members of the CCA will learn to swim proficiently using the various swimming strokes such as freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly. Our swimmers also get a chance to represent the school in the Swimming National School Games.

Other than improving the technique and ability of our swimmers, the activities carried out during training sessions also inculcate values such as positive thinking, self-discipline, respect, sportsmanship and determination.

Through participation in the CCA, our swimmers will endeavour towards maintaining and improving their physical fitness, thus creating a lifelong orientation towards managing their health and well-being.

#### **CCA Achievement**
Students from our Swimming CCA took part in the 60th National Primary School Swimming Championships 2019. Our boys’ 4 x 50m Freestyle Relay team attained a commendable 5th position in the Final and achieved a personal best timing.
