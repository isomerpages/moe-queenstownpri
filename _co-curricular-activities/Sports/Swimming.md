<h4><strong>About CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The swimming CCA aims to develop competitive swimmers, by providing them
with a platform to develop their potential. Members of the CCA will learn
to swim proficiently using the various swimming strokes such as freestyle,
backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly. Our swimmers also get a chance
to represent the school in the Swimming National School Games.</p>
<p>Other than improving the technique and ability of our swimmers, the activities
carried out during training sessions also inculcate values such as positive
thinking, self-discipline, respect, sportsmanship and determination.</p>
<p>Through participation in the CCA, our swimmers will endeavour towards
maintaining and improving their physical fitness, thus creating a lifelong
orientation towards managing their health and well-being.</p>
