<h4><strong>About CCA</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>BB Motto: Sure and Steadfast</strong></h5>
<p>The Boys’ Brigade Movement has been in Singapore since 1930. Queenstown
Primary School is proud to be the hosting school for the 67J Singapore
Company. To achieve the objectives of the Boys’ Brigade, the boys engage
in meaningful programmes so that they can lead and serve. The boys are
actively guided by teachers and adult volunteers from our partner Church,
the Church of the Good Shepherd. Although a Christian-based CCA, we welcome
boys of any religion.</p>
<p>We pay great emphasis to the character and physical well-being of our
boys. Each boy develops the habit of discipline, self-respect, teamwork
and service.</p>
<h5><strong>Experiences</strong></h5>
<p>- Foot drills (self-discipline, teamwork)
<br>- Outdoor adventure skills (problem-solving, resourcefulness)
<br>- Bible-based values and character-building lessons (values and character
education)
<br>- Games (physical and mental well-being)</p>
<h5><strong>Confident Individual</strong></h5>
<p>Students learn about values to shape them into responsible and caring
young teens. They learn more about their own strengths and weaknesses and
learn to be more disciplined.</p>
<h5><strong>Caring Citizen</strong></h5>
<p>Students learn to take care of one another in the CCA group. Every year,
we participate in BB Care, which is the community service activity for
the Boys’ Brigade. In recent years, our boys have been going to nursing
homes to visit the residents, as well as packing and distributing essentials
for migrant workers with their parents during the end-of-year school-based
camp.</p>
<h5><strong>Effective Leader</strong></h5>
<p>Most BB activities are done in group settings where students learn to
work with one another to achieve the goals. Competitions like Adventure
Quest and Character Quest also promote team efforts, where communication
and collaboration between members of the team are key areas for success.</p>
<h5><strong>Platforms available in Boys' Brigade</strong></h5>
<p>Adventure Quest, Character Quest, camps, service work (e.g. BB Care, visit
to nursing homes), flag bearers for School National Day Commemoration,
BB Week fund raising.</p>
