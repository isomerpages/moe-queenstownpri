#### **About CCA**
##### **GB Singapore Mission**
Developing each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling:<br>
Every Girl becoming a leader<br>
Every Officer a servant leader

The GB members engage in meaningful activities led by their teachers and volunteer adult leaders, with character development as a key focus. Through the completion of tasks and participation in events such as in annual camps, enrolment service, drill competitions and other national challenges like GB Friendship Day, the girls earn badges and gain a sense of achievement and pride. They will develop multiple skills, such as communication and collaboration skills, as well as critical and inventive thinking which are crucial in this 21st century.

Through these experiences, the members will become a Confident Individual, Caring Citizen and Effective Leader.&nbsp;Although a Christian-based CCA, we welcome girls of any religion to join us.
