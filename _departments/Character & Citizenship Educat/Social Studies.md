### **Social Studies**
Social Studies aims to prepare our students to be Informed, Concerned and Participative citizens of tomorrow by helping them to understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in.

The curriculum encourages students to inquire about real-world issues that concern their lives. This is to help them attain relevant knowledge and understanding of these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate different perspectives. The subject seeks to inculcate in students the values that define the Singaporean society and nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live in and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.
