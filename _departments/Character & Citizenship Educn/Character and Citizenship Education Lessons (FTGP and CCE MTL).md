Lessons in CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) use stories, scenarios, songs and games, Lessons are designed to reinforce teaching and learning of values, develop social-emotional competencies and nurture citizenship dispositions. In QtPS, we leverage different pedagogical tools such as interactive games, role play, perspective taking and case studies to help them learn about values and develop their character.
