Internationalisation Programme Committee @ QtPS plans overseas learning journeys with the intent to cultivate leadership and social entrepreneurship capabilities amongst our pupils to better prepare them to thrive in a fast changing and highly connected world. Through the immersion programmes both locally and overseas, the IP aims to broaden pupilsâ€™ knowledge and perspectives through experiential learning and solution oriented thinking; to encourage self-learning and self determination; develop social and cultural skill; encourage understanding and friendship; instil a greater sense of national identity and pride in our pupils .
