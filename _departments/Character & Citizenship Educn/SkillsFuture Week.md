<h4><strong>SkillsFuture Week @ QtPS</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our effort to help students explore various professions and
understand the world of work, Queenstown Primary School organised our annual <strong>SkillsFuture Week</strong>.
This event aims to inspire students to appreciate the value of different
occupations and to begin thinking about their aspirations and interests
from a young age.</p>
<p>This year, students had the exciting opportunity to explore interactive
booths set up around the school. Among the highlights were <strong>VR experiences</strong> hosted
by <strong>PayPal</strong> and <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>, where
students immersed themselves in realistic simulations to understand the
roles involved in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>healthcare innovation</strong>.
These booths offered hands-on, experiential learning that sparked curiosity
and introduced students to future-ready industries.</p>

<p>We were also delighted to welcome <strong>Brera Bakery</strong>, whose
representative not only brought in an array of delicious baked goods but
also shared her <strong>passion for the craft of baking</strong>. Students
learned about the skills involved in running a bakery and the joy of turning
a passion into a profession.</p>

<p>In addition, several <strong>Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong> members
came forward to share about their <strong>own jobs and career journeys</strong>,
giving students a personal glimpse into the working world. Their stories
helped students understand the diversity of pathways and the importance
of values such as resilience and lifelong learning.</p>

<p>The week culminated in meaningful conversations in class, where students
reflected on what they had learnt and how their interests might align with
future careers. At Queenstown Primary, we believe that nurturing early
career awareness and curiosity is an important step in developing confident,
future-ready learners.</p>
