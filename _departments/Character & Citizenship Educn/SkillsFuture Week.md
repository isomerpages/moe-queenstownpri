### **SkillsFuture Week**
#### **SkillsFuture Week @ Queenstown Primary School**
Skillsfuture Week is one of the students’ highlight each year. Since 2016, we have been organising this programme for our students. In that week, we invite speakers to share with our students about their jobs and why they embarked on that journey. Primary 5 and 6 students also participate in a Career Quest through a career exhibition held in school. There, they are able to interact with professionals and query them about their jobs face-to-face while interacting with the exhibits that they display at the various booths. Our internal survey shows more than 95% of the students enjoying this particular activity. In 2019 we also had the honour of hosting a small group of students from 4 other schools in our SkillsFuture Exhibition, a testament of the fine work we have done over the years.

Our volunteers include Junior Achievement Singapore which supports some of the work we do, members of various corporate organisations and our very own PSG.

Over the years we have had these volunteers attend the SkillsFuture Fair:
*   BoxGreen
*   SMRT
*   Singapore Police Force
*   S.E.A Guardians of the Oceans
*   Cherie Hearts Pre-school
*   Johnson and Johnson

*   NTU - SPMS
*   Bera’s Fine Bakery
*   Fashion for a Cause
*   St. Andrew’s Nursing Home
*   Rainbow Centre

In 2021, the SkillsFuture Fair was organised virtually for our students and we were able to invite professionals to share about their jobs over Zoom.  SuperSteam even managed to send one engineer onsite together with a robot to share more about what they do - the students were really enthused and excited about this.
