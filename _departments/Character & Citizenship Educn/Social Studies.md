Social Studies aims to&nbsp;prepare our students to be Informed, Concerned and Participative citizens of tomorrow&nbsp;by helping them to understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in.

The curriculum encourages students to inquire about real-world issues that concern their lives. This is to help them attain relevant knowledge and understanding of these issues,&nbsp;develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and&nbsp;appreciate different perspectives. The subject seeks to&nbsp;inculcate in students the values that define the Singaporean society&nbsp;and&nbsp;nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live&nbsp;in&nbsp;and&nbsp;demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.
