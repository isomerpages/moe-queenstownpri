### **Class Leaders Training**
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have shifted to a blended approach where P3-P6 class leaders will complete an online SLS Assignment to prepare themselves for their respective roles. There are 2 termly class leaders committee sessions with their Form Teachers for them to share their challenges and also discuss solutions and improvements for class matters.

#### **Purpose of activity**
*   For departments to train up the various class leaders holding subject monitor or ambassador roles.

The Head Prefect Election is an opportunity for the student voice to be heard. P5 Prefects interested to run for the election go through a process of nomination and interview to be selected to be one of the candidates to run for the election.
