of quest for knowledge with the progress of strength and character. Recognising
the potential in every student’s ability to develop as a leader, Student
Leadership Development creates opportunities to teach students the four
school values and allows students to demonstrate these values through leadership

appropriate experiences are designed for our students to provide them with
opportunities to discover, develop and exercise their leadership capabilities.

<br><strong>Tiered developmental in-house programmes and Mentorship</strong> (with
reference to the 5 Leadership Practices):</p>
<p>Tier 1: Every Queenstowner goes through baseline leadership training during
FTGP lessons.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Class Committee members go through trainings to prepare them for
their roles to support teachers and students in their learning. Form teachers
mentor class committee members in the discharge of their duties through
daily observations and mentorship during the scheduled form teacher time.</p>
<p>Tier 3: CCA Leaders and Prefects go through training to equip them with
skills to be empathetic leaders to lead their CCAs and the school population.
CCA Leaders and Prefects are mentored by CCA teachers and teachers in the
Student Leadership Committee respectively.</p>
<p>Tier 4: Head Prefects, Vice Head Prefects and Senior Prefects are given
opportunities and support from teachers to mentor Prefects and plan school
wide events. Teachers in the Student Leadership Committee mentor this group
of Prefects.</p>
<p><strong>External Workshops</strong>
<br>Prefects go through external workshops to gain external perspective in
their own development as leaders of QtPS.</p>
<p><strong>Service to School</strong>
<br>All appointed student leaders will serve the school at the various levels
(class, CCA, cohort, school).</p>
<p><strong>Reflective Practice</strong>
<br>Central to the development of the 5 leadership practices is reflective
practice. Student Leaders will reflect upon their learning at various junctures
through guided reflections.</p>

<p>Student Leadership Development is guided by the 5 Leadership Practices
to co-construct and build all Queenstowners’ knowledge and growth in student
leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Model the Way</strong>
<br>Student Leaders need to take personal responsibility and to consistently
model the right values and behaviour to act as role models for the rest
of the school. As leaders, they would learn to “walk the talk” and demonstrate
their commitments by aligning their actions with QTOs and school values.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inspire a Shared Vision</strong>
<br>As leaders of teams and as role models, student leaders need to be reflective
and inspire others to become enthusiastic supporters of the school values
and QtOs. Student Leaders understand that the leadership journey is a dialogue
and involves other stakeholders.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Challenge the Process</strong>
<br>Student Leaders should treat challenges as adventures and crucible of
learning, they should use their voice and purposefully synthesise and advocate
for bold ideas that serve the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Encourage the Heart</strong>
<br>Student Leaders inspire others with courage, hope and optimism, and will
recognise the work of their peers. Student Leaders care for and look after
the members of the school, will create a spirit of community that is reflective
to create good outcomes for the school as leadership is an ongoing learning
loop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Enable Others to Act</strong>
<br>Student Leaders form strong partnerships, peer support, and relationships,
they will use collaboration, empathy, and mutual respect to create win-win
outcomes for the school and the students. Student Leaders work with each
other to enhance their competence and confidence.</p>
