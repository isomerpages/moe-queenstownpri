### **ICT**
The QtPS ICT Department is committed to the national and school vision of nurturing Future-ready Digital Citizens, and have invested in the tools, programmes and appropriate training to help our teachers achieve that aim.

In 2020, we piloted the _Introduction to Computational Thinking_ Programme where our Primary 1 and 2 students learn the basics of Computational Thinking through the Matatalab platform, a screen-free coding toy. Through this 4-hour program conducted during our schools' Experiential Week, our young Queenstowners practise their Critical Thinking, collaboration and problem solving skills all through play!

We strive to imbue our students with the appropriate dispositions to harness ICT for life-long learning, rather than merely equipping them with technical skills. At the same time, advancement in technology has given our students more options and varied ways to express their ideas.

Our students therefore learn to use a variety of digital tools within the context of the national curriculum. For example, our Lower Primary students pick up the basics of _Powerpoint_ and _Keynote_ skills during Art lessons to create Digital Art. Upper Primary students are exposed to simple video editing using _Apple Clips_ to create videos on the topic of Environmental Conservation.

We believe that learning need not be confined within the walls of the classroom and have invested in mobile devices and a robust wireless internet infrastructure to empower teachers to take learning anywhere.
