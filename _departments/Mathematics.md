<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every Child, A Critical Thinker, A Problem Solver and a Math Enthusiast</p>
<h4><strong>Our Beliefs</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every student matters and can achieve a level of mastery of Mathematics
that will serve them well in their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching and Learning of Mathematics should develop students’ competencies
of thinking critically in an uncertain situation, making decisions in various
contexts and collaborating and communicating with others.</p>
</li>

<h4><strong>Our Guiding Principles</strong></h4>
<p>Math Educators in Queenstown Primary School are guided by the following
principles:</p>
<h5><strong>1. Pedagogical Plurality is Key</strong></h5>
<p>Each child is unique and learns differently. As 21st century Math Educators
we explore various teaching strategies that are student-centric and seek
to better engage and provide the necessary support and stretch for our
students.</p>
<h5><strong>2. Consistency is the Strategy</strong></h5>
<p>We work collaboratively with our colleagues to explore ideas together
as a team and continue building our professional expertise to raise the
quality of teaching and learning of Mathematics.</p>
<h5><strong>3. Reasoning and Communication is our Cornerstone</strong></h5>
<p>As we strive to develop our students to be Critical Thinkers and effective
Problem Solvers, we continue to provide opportunities for students to explain
their reasoning and work with their peers in the classroom.</p>

<p>Guided by the 3 principles, our Educators instill a&nbsp;<strong><em>joy of learning</em></strong>&nbsp;in
Maths by orchestrating meaningful learning experiences in the classroom
that allow students to discover mathematical ideas and co-construct mathematical
knowledge with their peer. With sound mathematical knowledge, students
are guided to adopt a systematic approach through Polya’s Problem Solving
process to solve math problems. Teaching of Maths is made accessible for
all students through the use of the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach
that makes the understanding of key Math concepts accessible for all students.</p>
<h4><strong>Math Trail</strong></h4>
<p>We place a premium on enabling our students to apply their mathematical
thinking beyond the realms of the Math Classroom. The P4 &amp; P5 Math
Trail facilitated by our P4 and P5 Math Ambassadors is an example of one
such initiative.</p>
