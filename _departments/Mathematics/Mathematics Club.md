#### **Our Approach**
Our training methodology is focused on developing studentsâ€™ critical and creative thinking in Mathematics by empowering them to engage in exploration and discovery of Mathematical skills and knowledge. The lesson content is varied to provide opportunities for student interaction and collaboration as well as preparing students for competitions. Students play, create problems, identify patterns and make generalisations through a multi-modal approach.

Students apply their mathematical thinking and develop their leadership skills by facilitating the P4 and P5 Math Trail for their school mates.
