#### **Key Strategies**
The QtPS PE department strives to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. Students are engaged through a variety of experiences in areas such as Athletics, Dance, Games &amp; Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Swimming and Physical Health &amp; Fitness.

The curriculum is structured progressively with lower primary students focusing on developing their fundamental motor skills, while the upper primary students will learn more complex combination of motor skills and game-related concepts. The varied experiences in PE will develop studentsâ€™ self-confidence and problem-solving skills. They also learn to become effective team players as they work collaboratively with one another.
