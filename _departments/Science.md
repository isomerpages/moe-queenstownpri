<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>A Community of Learners, Sharing the Joy of Inquiry Science.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Strategies</strong></h4>
<p>QtPS Science Teaching &amp; Learning aims to nurture&nbsp;<strong>reflective learners</strong>&nbsp;by
providing our students with engaging learning experiences that develop
their process skills, habits of mind and attitudes for scientific inquiry.
In the design of the learning experiences, students will be able to relate
the role of Science in their daily life, society and the environment.</p>
<p>Our Science curriculum focuses on teaching and learning through inquiry
via a variety of ICT tools, the use of toys as learning tools and experiential
hands-on experiments. These opportunities are provided to stimulate curiosity
in our students to become&nbsp;<strong>problem solvers</strong>&nbsp;that
explore within and outside the confines of the classroom. They learn to
collaborate in groups to formulate predictions, organise and interpret
data, and communicate results while learning Science in a fun way.</p>

<h4><strong>Outdoor Learning</strong></h4>
<p>The school conducts outdoor learning which brings the students out of
the class and textbooks. Outdoors and the wider community provide rich
and authentic learning environments that allow students to learn and see
Science in action.</p>
