Co-curricular Activities (CCA) play a key role in students' holistic development. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents. Through CCA, students develop their character, learn values, social-emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.

CCA bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community.

Watch our **students' interviews** where they share their experiences as they pursue their interest and ideas in our broad range of CCAs available in school.
