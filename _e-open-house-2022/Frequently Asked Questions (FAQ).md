Due to the changing situation, the school will advise parents/guardians on the confirmed dates and platforms for these events closer to the date. Please visit the school website for confirmation.

**22. When can parents/guardians apply for MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)?**<br>
Application for MOE FAS opens on P1 Admin Day (October). Approval and collection of school books and uniforms will be tentatively in November.

##### **Daily Concerns: School Bag, Recess, etc**
**23. Are students expected to carry a heavy bag to school daily?**<br>
School bags must be manageable as students will be required to move between different classrooms and levels for various lessons. To manage the load, some books are kept in school by teachers or in the students' individual lockers. Students are advised to pack their books and learning materials according to the timetable and avoid adding unnecessary weight to their bags. 

**24. What times do Primary 1s have their breaks?**<br>
*   Recess Time: 10.00am to 10.30am (30 mins) in the canteen.
*   Elevenses (snack break): 12.15pm to 12.30pm (15 mins) in the classroom.

Parents/guardians should pack light, healthy snacks that can be easily eaten in the classroom. 

**25. What should students bring for recess? How much money should they bring?**<br>
Students should bring plain water in water bottles, refillable at water coolers around the school. Students may bring their own food in lunch boxes or purchase food from the canteen. Water bottles and lunch boxes must be clearly labelled with the studentâ€™s name and class. 

If a student is buying food and drink from the canteen, a good amount to bring is $2.00 to $2.50 in cash. Set meals range from $1.50 to $2.00. Drinks range from $0.50 to $1.00. 

For students who prefer to go cashless, POSB Smart Buddy watches and the accompanying parents' phone app may be used. Application details will be provided before P1 Admin Day.

Students under MOE or SAC Financial Assistance Schemes (FAS) will have money credited to them in their Ez-Link cards upon activation for them to purchase their meals. 

It would be good to teach your child how to count money in preparation for school. Do give your child smaller denominations, like 50-cent coins or $1 coins, as these are easier for them to handle. Please avoid $5 or $10 notes. 

**26. Is there Halal food sold in the canteen?**<br>
Stalls 5, 6 and 7 are Halal Certified by MUIS and sell Halal food only. Stall 8 sells Halal steamed buns.
