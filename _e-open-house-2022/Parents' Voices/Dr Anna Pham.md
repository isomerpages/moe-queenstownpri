My son is a student of P1 Creativity in Queenstown Primary school. I am delighted to have chosen this school for him. The school is of convenient distance for transportation. My son can walk to school, take public transport or even cycle to school.

I like the way QtPS teachers guide and help my son to grow and glow.  A term has passed, I can see that my son loves school so much that every day, when he comes back home, he will share with me new things that he has learnt from teachers and classmates.

He is very happy to be assigned as a Security Monitor (amazing job and it’s my first time hearing about this position). It is a great start for him to learn to care for people around him and be a true gentleman, and a responsible and helpful boy.

He strives to be a leader and seeks to improve himself by learning how to solve the Rubik's Cube. He can currently solve it within about 2 minutes. He wants to share this with his classmates one day if he has a chance.

He pays more attention in learning the electrical guitar because he hopes that one day, he can to perform in the school hall during the assembly period. He also tells me that his music teacher commended his great dance performance and good understanding of the musical skills. He practises Wushu, plays Golf and chess as well. I hope that all this learning experiences will be able to help him choose a suitable CCA in the future. He really has changed so much after 1 term of study at Queenstown Primary School.

During the first day of school, I had the opportunity to meet other parents who have really put in a lot of effort to learn and play with their kids. I had the opportunity to help as a parent volunteer in the Junior Achievement Programme. I have learnt so many things from the kids and understood what I can to do for my son when he is not in school. I really feel appreciated what the teachers have to deal with many students in the class.

Once again, I am very excited to bring my son to school every morning and I am looking forward to see him growing up with well.
