##### **Why do you or your child like the school?**
I have 2 children studying in Queenstown Primary School (“QtPS”) and my older girl is in Primary 4 while my younger boy is in Primary 1 this year. I graduated from QtPS so naturally I will enrol my children in the same primary school as location was one of the considering factors. However, before making the final decision, I actually went online to check on reviews for neighbourhood schools in Queenstown area and saw quite a number of positive feedback about QtPS.

Here are some to share:
*   They have a student care within the school compound
*   The communication platform between school and parents is awesome (Term Letter, Class Dojo, and Class Whatsapp chat group)
*   They have many international students and to recognise and celebrate the cultural diversity, **International Friendship Day** is always done in a grand scale by the school in collaboration with the Parent Support Group. They have a very strong PSG team who is very supportive of the school’s initiative and events

What impressed me was the parents support group linked the parents up through Whatsapp. As a parent of a P1 girl back then, this was important to me. Parents could communicate and get to know one another and share information even before the school starts.

What impressed me was how teachers are assigned to the classes. The form teachers are assigned to the same class for 2 years so that the students will be more comfortable with their teachers and the teachers in return gain trust from the students. By doing so, the teachers could follow through and get to know theirs students’ strengths and weaknesses and this will allow the teachers to tailor their efforts to individual student needs.

Besides the core education that our children received, the school also emphasised on the outcome of their students and prepare them to be a **confident individual, self-directed learner, an active contributor** as well as **a concerned citizen**, through other curriculum or activities giving the students team learning experience, allowing them to develop skills.

##### **How does QtPS make you feel special?**
I was invited to join the Parent Support Group when my older child was in Primary 1 and I volunteered in the Junior Achievement Programme. Junior Achievement Programme is where Parent Volunteers get to teach the lower primary the basics of financial literacy. It gives the opportunity for the children to learn basic understanding of money, concept of earning and saving, identify basic needs and wants and common understanding of business in the community. I had the experience on how it was like being a teacher in the classroom environment.

It was really amazing to teach 30 students with different personalities and it gave me the opportunity to work with the form teachers and fellow parents to teach in the school. I believe not many parents have this special wonderful experience to be a “Teacher” in your children’s primary school.
