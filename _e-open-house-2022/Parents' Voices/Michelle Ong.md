##### **Why my children & I like the school?**
The caring culture of the school is something my 2 children & I like right from the beginning when my daughter started P1 back in 2015 til now that my son is in P6.

My children like the teachers in the school. They like the way the teachers teach, giving clear explanations, guiding them and giving them ample opportunities to learn & explore. The teachers are very caring, constantly checking to ask how they are doing/coping.

My children also like their friends & classmates in the school. Most of them are helpful & kind. They appreciate & treasure the time they have playing & exploring together. They not only always help one another but they also learn from one another through sharing of ideas and group/teamwork assigned by the respective subject teachers.

QtPS offers a holistic education where both my children are given ample opportunities to grow, explore & develop their potential in different areas.

Both my children were selected as the emcees for the schoolâ€™s CNY celebration and National Day celebration program/ activities. Through these, they have had the opportunities to display their potential & talent in these areas.

Last year, my son was also selected to do a Chinese Cross Talk with another boy as one of the CNY celebration activities in school. It was a rare & golden opportunity and I am glad that he enjoyed it to the fullest & did a great job!

Besides these, both my children also have had the opportunities to represent the school in various competitions, eg Maths Olympiad Competitions, Singapore Primary Science Olympiad, National Chinese Challenge, National Chinese Essay Writing Competitions, etc. All these are very good experiences & exposure for them while learning takes place in school as these opportunities help them to develop their potential & excel in different areas.

##### **Why does QtPS make u feel special?**
The caring culture of QtPS makes us feel like home / a big happy family!

As the school believes in working hand in hand with parents to develop and bring out the best in our children holistically, the teachers are constantly in communication with me, updating me on the progress of my children not only in academic aspects but also in non-academic aspects. This long-term partnership makes us feel like we are friends, and the feeling is heartwarming. The best partnership between teachers & parents indeed!

My children truly enjoy their learning journey in QtPS where they grow, glow & soar to greater heights.

Thank you QtPS for giving them the opportunities!
