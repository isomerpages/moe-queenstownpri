##### **Why do you or your child like the school?**
Initially, I am attracted to this school on their racial diversity of the children and the adoption of external life-long skill programs, such as Junior Achievement, as part of the study curriculum at the school. However, the racial diversity has diminished over the recent years due to the increased popularity of the school in the populous Queenstown neighbourhood.

The opportunity of constant interactions with the School Leaders, Teachers and Fellow Parents really make me like the school the most! The school has also given ample opportunity to every child. My two kids at this school had their fair share of opportunities to participate and represent the school at various events. My elder daughter who had completed her education at QtPS, still looks forward to "catch up" with her previous school teachers at every chance.

##### **How does QtPS make you feel special?**
The strong support and bonding of the School Leaders, Teachers, Admin Staff, and Parent Support Group have made this school special. There are always ample means and avenues to reach out to the school and parent volunteers to get updated information about the school and parenting support. The famous motto of "You'll Never Walk Alone" is being practised at this school!

Thank you very much to the school for educating and grooming my two Queenstowners!
