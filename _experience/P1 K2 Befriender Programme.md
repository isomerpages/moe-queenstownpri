<h3><strong>Primary 1: K2 Befriender Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The K2 Befriender Programme is a unique initiative that pairs Primary
1 students with K2 children from selected partner preschools. The heart
of the programme lies in the facilitated letter exchanges between buddies,
which forms part of the Primary 1 English curriculum. As the correspondence
progresses, Primary 1 students are prepared to be welcoming hosts and mentors.
The programme culminates in a half-day visit to Queenstown Primary School,
where K2 students experience primary school life firsthand. During this
visit, Primary 1 buddies guide their K2 bdudies through the school and
the kindergarteners will also get to attend regular P1 lessons with their
P1 buddies. Following the visit, both groups reflect on their experiences,
reinforcing the valuable lessons learned. This programme serves multiple
purposes:</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Development:</strong> Primary 1 students take on the
role of caring mentors, guiding their younger counterparts. This responsibility
nurtures leadership qualities in our youngest primary school students.</p>
<p><strong>Literacy Enhancement</strong>: The programme integrates seamlessly
with English lessons. Primary 1 students practise their writing skills
by exchanging letters with their K2 buddies, fostering a pen pal relationship
that enhances communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>School Transition Support:</strong> K2 students benefit from this
programme as it helps ease their transition from kindergarten to primary
school. They gain familiarity with the primary school environment and routines
through their Primary 1 buddies.</p>
<p>Through this programme, Primary 1 students demonstrate care and gratitude
towards their junior buddies, embodying the school's values in a practical,
meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Preschool participation:</u></strong></h4>
<p>Queenstown Primary School warmly invites preschools interested in participating
in the K2 Befriender Programme for the academic year 2025 to register their

for K2 students to familiarise themselves with the primary school environment
and build confidence for their upcoming transition. If your preschool would
like to be a part of this enriching experience, please register your interest

<p>Kindly note that we will contact selected preschools by the end of March
using the details provided in the registration form. Due to the volume

young learners in their transition to primary school.</p>
