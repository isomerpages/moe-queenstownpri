### **Parents Gateway**

Parents Gateway is a new digital platform developed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to parents to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes and activities. This enables parents to better support their child in their education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools.

#### **Accessing Parents Gateway**
We invite you to download the free Parents Gateway mobile app onto your mobile phone in the links provided below. Parents Gateway contains sensitive information about students and their parents. Access to the mobile app is restricted to parents and legal guardians who are Singpass holders. You may refer to the [Parents Gateway FAQ](https://staging.d3haevm43m8pfu.amplifyapp.com/information/parents-gateway/FAQ/) for more information on applying for a Singpass.

To safeguard our students’ data, only parents who are registered in the official student records in the MOE database will be able to use the mobile app.

The school is taking a measured approach in transiting into using the app. In this transition period, we will continue to give out physical copies of letters and consent forms. Parents who are on board Parents Gateway may choose to respond through the Parents Gateway app or by signing and returning the hardcopy of the letter/consent forms that require a response.
