##### **Daily Concerns: School Bag, Recess, etc**
**23. Are students expected to carry a heavy bag to school daily?**<br>
School bags must be manageable as students will be required to move between different classrooms and levels for various lessons. To manage the load, some books are kept in school by teachers or in the students' individual lockers. Students are advised to pack their books and learning materials according to the timetable and avoid adding unnecessary weight to their bags. 

**24. What times do Primary 1s have their breaks?**<br>
*   Recess Time: 9.00am to 9.30am (30 mins) in the canteen.

Parents/guardians should pack light, healthy snacks that can be easily eaten in the classroom. 

**25. What should students bring for recess? How much money should they bring?**<br>
Students should bring plain water in water bottles, refillable at water coolers around the school. Students may bring their own food in lunch boxes or purchase food from the canteen. Water bottles and lunch boxes must be clearly labelled with the studentâ€™s name and class. 

If a student is buying food and drink from the canteen, a good amount to bring is $2.00 to $2.60 in cash/ePayment. Set meals range from $1.80 to $2.00. Drinks range from $0.80 to $1.20. 

For students who prefer to go cashless, POSB Smart Buddy watches may be used. Application details will be provided before P1 Admin Day.

Students under MOE FASor School-Based Financial Assistance Schemes will have money credited to them in their Ez-Link cards upon activation for them to purchase their meals. 

It would be good to teach your child how to count money in preparation for school. Do give your child smaller denominations, like 50-cent coins or $1 coins, as these are easier for them to handle. Please avoid $5 or $10 notes. 

**26. Is there Halal food sold in the canteen?**<br>
Stalls 5, 6 and 7 are Halal Certified by MUIS and sell Halal food only. Stall 8 sells Halal steamed buns.

For the first 2 weeks of school, P1 students will be paired with P4 buddies during recess.

P4 buddies will assist P1 students with recess routines such as buying food at the canteen and items from the bookshop. They will also get P1 students familiar with the school compound and be a friend to them.

Form Teachers, the Year Head/Assistant Year Head for P1 as well as student leaders will also be guiding your child/ward when moving around the school.

**28. When is P1 Orientation Day? What happens on this day?**<br>
P1 Orientation Day will be between 13 November to 17 November 2023 (tentatively).  Both parents/guardians and students will be invited to P1 Orientation Day.

Parents/guardians will be welcomed and engaged by our school leaders (Principal and Vice-principals) in the hall on important school information to kick-start their child's / ward's journey as part of our QtPS family.

##### **Student Management**
**29. How does the school manage bullying?**<br>
All students are educated on what bullying is at various platforms, such as during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons. Students are taught explicit skills to manage or report bullying cases to their teachers. Students are also encouraged to share their concerns with a trusted adult, such as parents and teachers. The school works hand in hand with parents on any concern raised.

In the event that bullying has been reported, Form Teachers and Year Heads will carry out thorough investigations with all parties involved, ensuring the accuracy of information and fairness to all parties involved. If the case of bullying is found to be true, necessary follow-ups with parents and students involved will take place. The aim of these follow-ups is to educate students about their actions and consequences. In QtPS, we take on restorative practices and social skills equipping as two of our core practices to educate our students and to mend relationships that have been strained. In more serious cases, the discipline master will be called upon for further investigations and to mete out necessary consequences. The school adopts a zero tolerance stance towards bullying.

##### **Special Education Needs (SEN)**
**30. How does the school support students with learning and behavioural needs?**<br>
Support for students learning and behavioural needs is available in the school. A team of specially trained teachers, Allied Educators (Learning &amp; Behavioural Support) [AED(LBS)], Allied Educators (Counselling) [AED(Counselling)], as well as MOE Psychologists work together to identify and support students' needs through various programmes and Individualised Education Plans (IEPs).

##### **Transition from Kindergarten to Primary School**
**31. How will students be supported in their transition from kindergarten to primary school and adjust to new primary school life and longer school hours?**<br>
Sitting through longer school hours is inevitable in primary school due to the more extensive school syllabus.<br>
The school will support studentsâ€™ transition to primary school through<br>
*   P1 Orientation Day
*   P1 Level transition programmes, such as Year Head engagement sessions, P4 Recess Buddy Programme, and other level and class bonding activities.
*   Emphasis on class routines, with a slower pace of work and no or less homework in the first month of school
*   Specially crafted lesson packages on the transition to Primary School and gaining greater school independence
*   Allied Educator and Counsellor support for students with higher needs

The school will also monitor the transition of students through Year Head and level teachers' check-in meetings.

**32. How can I prepare my child/ward for the transition from kindergarten to primary school?**<br>
Parents/guardians can support your child's/ward's transition through home preparation before the start of school, such as<br>

*   establishing a good sleeping routine with an early bedtime, e.g. 9 pm
*   getting ready in the morning for school
*   reading the timetable accurately
*   packing the school bag
*   filing in worksheets neatly in files
*   counting small denominations of money
*   washing hands with soap before and after eating
*   covering nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing

**33. Must P1 students be toilet trained?**<br>
Yes, all students must be toilet trained in order for them to move about independently in school. As going to the toilet is a private and personal affair, it is best that your child/ward is able to go to the toilet and clean up after herself/himself independently.

In the event your child/ward accidentally soils himself/herself, the school can assist your child/ward to change into a new set of school uniform at the General Office, subject to the availability of spare school uniforms and sizes.

##### **Co-Curricular Activities**
**34. Are there Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) for P1 students?**<br>
