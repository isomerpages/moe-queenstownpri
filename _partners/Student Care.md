### **Student Care**

##### **QUEENSTOWN PRIMARY STUDENT CARE CENTRE (QTSCC)**
The Student Care Centre (SCC) at Queenstown Primary School was set up to cater to the needs of the student population. NASCANS, Singapore’s Top Student Care Brand with more than 15 years of experience was appointed to manage the SCC.

##### **AN “OASIS BETWEEN SCHOOL AND HOME”**
NASCANS is a provider of quality after-school student care services and has been voted as Singapore’s Top Brand for Student Care under the annual Influential Brands® Awards. First established in 2006, they have since amassed over 15 years of experience, benefitting thousands of students and parents through their unique SCC curriculum, efficient operations and quality standards of safety and care.

##### **A HOLISTIC STUDENT DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK**
At NASCANS, the range of signature SCC programmes follow a comprehensive and holistic student development framework designed to help equip students with skills and mindsets that are aligned with the values, competencies and outcomes set out in MOE’s 21st Century Competencies framework, while also developing students’ character and values in line with Queenstown Primary’s vision, mission and values.

The 4 main pillars of the student development framework include:

* Homework Supervision
* Character Education
* Outdoor Activities
* Enrichment Programmes

There are also exciting holiday programmes organised for the students during the school holidays, and it includes a holistic range of activities from outings to workshops.

##### **CONDUCIVE AND COLLABORATIVE LEARNING SPACES**
The NASCANS environment is designed as an “Oasis between School and Home”. NASCANS creates a homely feel and transforms the SCC room as a place for children to learn, rest and play in a safe and controlled environment. The conducive setting allows for better concentration and comfort for the students.

NASCANS aims to be an extension of the school, complementing and expanding on the range of services that the school provides. Together, it supports the School to achieve its mission of “School of the 21st Century, committed to providing a Holistic Education to all students.”
