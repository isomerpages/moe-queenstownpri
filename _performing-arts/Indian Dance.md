#### **About CCA**
Queenstown Primary School Indian Dance CCA provides a platform for students to learn and experience Indian culture through a mix of traditional and contemporary dance moves. Our dances are specially choreographed to blend Indian classical and folk rhythms with trendy Bhangra moves. The lively dance manoeuvers, executed in sync with the outgoing and expressive beats of Bollywood dance music are always a pleasure to watch, with audiences asking for more. Throughout the course of the Indian Dance CCA, our dancers learn the values of resilience, self-discipline and teamwork, while developing their bodyâ€™s natural rhythm, balance and coordination skills.

Through the Indian dance CCA, our students are provided with opportunities to be:

##### **Effective Leaders**
Our dance members are given the opportunity to lead the class in the warm-up exercises at the start of each dance practice. Students also take turns to lead during small group practices.

##### **Team Players**
Students learn to work together as a team and synchronise their steps and movements for their dance performances. Our dance members also learn to show keen awareness to their surroundings and perform effectively as a group.

##### **Confident Dancers**
Our dance members always seek to deliver the distinctive movements and nuances of Indian dance with confidence, excellent posture and coordination.

##### **Reflective Learners**
Our dance members complete weekly reflections in their dance journals using the Two Stars and a Wish format. After each dance practice, students will note down their strengths and areas of improvement in their journals. This helps students to keep track of their progress and make improvements.
