#### **About CCA**
The QtPS Basketball CCA aims to develop competent basketball players who demonstrate the school values of Respect, Resilience, Integrity and Gratitude. Teamwork and sportsmanship are also emphasized upon during game-play. During training sessions, our students work on their technical individual ball-handling skills such as passing, dribbling and shooting, as well as tactical knowledge and teamwork. Players will also have a chance to work on their cardiovascular fitness and speed during high-intensity drills.   Members are split into 2 groups, namely, the Competition Group and the Recreation Group, and the activities carried out during training are appropriate for the respective levels. Players will then have a chance to apply these skills and knowledge in the annual zonal competition and smaller-scaled competitions and friendly matches.   Through the pre-training routine and various platforms, students are provided with opportunities to become:

##### **Confident Individual**
