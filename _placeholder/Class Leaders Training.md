### **Class Leaders Training**

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have shifted to a blended approach where P3-P6 class leaders will complete an online SLS Assignment to prepare themselves for their respective roles. There are 2 termly class leaders committee sessions with their Form Teachers for them to share their challenges and also discuss solutions and improvements for class matters.

#### **Purpose of activity**

*   For departments to train up the various class leaders holding subject monitor or ambassador roles.Â
