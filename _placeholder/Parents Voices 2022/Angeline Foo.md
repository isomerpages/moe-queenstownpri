##### **Why does your child like the school?**
Opportunities for my children to discover their potential! Each child is recognised as an individual. All of them are given the space to grow &amp; discover.

QtPS gave all my kids different opportunities to develop themselves based on their interests &amp; potential.

*   Janelle had the opportunity represent QtPS on the leadership front &amp; was elated when she was offered direct school admission to a secondary school through the leadership development opportunities offered by QtPS.
*   Estelle discovered her potential &amp; passion in sports because of her PE teacher. She ended up being one of the four girls in her cohort who was selected from QtPS to participate in MOE Junior Sports Academy. To date, she has enjoyed learning taekwondo, basketball, badminton &amp; shooting.
*   Noel feels very excited &amp; motivated when QtPS discovered his talent in running. He always look forward to his training &amp; to represent QtPS for the National Track &amp; Field Meet.

QtPS has really given my kids the opportunity to develop their potential &amp; to excel as individuals. Thanks to QtPS for seeing the raw diamond in our children!

##### **Why does QtPS make u feel special?**
It feels like family!

The school believes in working with parents to develop their students. The school actively &amp; regularly work with the QtPS Parent Support Group to make this happen.

The saying "it takes a village to raise a child" says it all. I have never felt alone on this journey parenting my children. When my daughter who is taking PSLE this year suddenly fell very ill, the school teachers &amp; leaders really rallied behind her. The care &amp; help they offered really touched me to bits.

Parents like us really appreciate the collaborative leadership style of the school. The school leaders are really there for us parents!

Thank you QtPS leaders &amp; teachers!

Angeline, mother of Estelle Foo (6 Honesty), Noel Foo (4 Diligence), Janelle Foo (now Sec one)
