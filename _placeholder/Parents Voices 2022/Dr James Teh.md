### **Dr James Teh**

My child likes QtPS because of the teachers and friends. He likes the teachers because they teach interesting facts on various topics. For example, he enjoys learning about the parts of a bug and where it lives. Besides that, he also enjoys learning to do the right things. He learns to do wipe downs of the table after snack and recess breaks to help maintain cleanliness.

In addition, my son likes that his friends and classmates are kind. They are very helpful towards other classmates in learning and school activities.

Queenstown Primary School makes him feel special because it allows him to be himself and express his individuality. For example, the experiential learning week provides students opportunity to learn topics beyond the school syllabus. One of the highlights is working in a group to program robots, as he enjoys logic and programming.

I appreciate and the school has given me the opportunity to be part of the parent volunteer group. QtPS has a close knit community where the principal, teachers, parents and students work collaboratively to provide a conducive and interesting learning environment for the students.

Frequent communication by the principal, year heads and teachers enable parents to keep abreast with school related developments as well as the development of the individual student. The focus on teaching and imparting good values such as integrity and gratitude to the students is also very important for me as a parent.
