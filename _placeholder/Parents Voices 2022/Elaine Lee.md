It has been almost 4 months since Zac started Primary school and I ask him the same question every day, “ How are you doing in the school today?” in his response is always the same – “very good!”.

As a parent, I am very glad that Zac enjoys school very much. He likes going to school every day as he enjoys the variety of learning activities and the engagement with his teachers and friends. I personally think that QTPS is doing an excellent job in communication, which is very important as it helps parents-teachers to support one other towards educating the child in his school life.&nbsp; I have been receiving weekly updates from teachers on what happened in the week through photos and short messages through class Dojo. It makes a great difference as it helps me to stay in loop on Zac’s progress. I am also very impressed with how QTPS uses every resource, advantage and opportunity it has to grow students through parents volunteering program such as: Junior Achievement (which I participated in March), Chinese reading morning session and many other supporting programmes.

I am looking forward to see the school and teachers continuing to inspire the students to embrace learning and develop the students to reach their full potential.
