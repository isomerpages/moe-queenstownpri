##### **Why do you or your child like the school?**
I have had the unique opportunity to experience this from several angles, this being my 5th year serving as a parent volunteer in QtPS.

I like the fact that the school had provided a holistic approach for students. Each school interprets this differently. For the school, it’s about caring and customizing their approach to enable a child’s success. I lived through that experience as both my children have had a very smooth transition into P1 life, right up to my eldest who is now in P5. I am proud as my eldest observed and understood the humanities such as the importance of giving back to others and grew up volunteering whenever he can, over the years. My daughter was eager to join her elder brother in the school even several years before she was due to enter P1.

I have also witnessed the amount of dedication and effort put in by the school staff behind the scenes to make this possible through clear and concise communication. They have made certain that all students have opportunities, avenue and resources to succeed. This is further complimented by a strong, cohesive and supportive parent volunteer group of – I’d call them friends (parents) – helping with outreach efforts and balancing the approach for all students. In my opinion, the diversity among students, not just culturally, but geographically, is also a great plus.

Understandably, we all tend to worry about our child’s academic achievements too. The school’s overall student academic performance has been growing by leaps and bounds annually. I am assured that my children will see that opportunity to grow along with the school’s success.

##### **How does QtPS make you feel special?**
That’s not easy to generalize. Perhaps it’s because they have such a warm, personal approach to the interaction and engagement. Getting insights to how my children are doing at school is often a breeze, and yet, they continue to listen and make improvements along the way. I’m often impressed by the responsiveness.

It goes beyond the institution, it’s really the school’s culture that makes us, as parents, special.
