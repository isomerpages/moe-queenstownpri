##### **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS** 

**1.**    **What is the naming convention for Student iCON email address?**

a.    The student’s email address will be based on **Full Name@students.edu.sg**.

b.    Any space in the full name will be replaced with an underscore.

c.    Should the student’s full name have words such as “Bte” and “s/o”, they will not appear in the email address.

d.    The full name is limited to the first 4 words as given in their NRIC/FIN to keep the length of the email address manageable.

e.    For cases where students share the same full name, a number is added to the end (e.g. Jon\_Tan, Jon\_Tan\_1, Jon\_Tan\_2) to differentiate their email addresses.
	
**2.**    **Can I request to change my child/ward’s email address?**

 All students’ email addresses follow their full name as reflected in MOE’s records and have been predetermined according to the naming conventions stated above to make the email addresses easier to remember, manageable in length and at the same time provide enough differentiation between similar email addresses.

Please refer to the following table for guidance on the Operating System/browser which students can use to log in.
